    feat: Change in application styles
    
    Now the application has a monochrome color palette.
    
    The main panel of the canvas section will no longer be visible,
    this is to make it easier to add a system to rotate the canvas in the future.

    feat: break animation and loop mode
    
    The animation can now be stopped thanks to a new icon implemented in the timeline header.
    Furthermore, the animation is no longer played by clicking on a keyframe,
    but from the same icon that is modified depending on the "isPlaying" state.
    The animation breaking method is managed thanks to the use of a ref called "shouldStopRef".
    
    In addition, there is now a new playback mode: "loop mode".
    It is established from the header of the timeline.

    feat: new playback system.
    
    Now the animation can be played by clicking on any frame on the timeline.
    The playback system follows the Double buffering design.
    And it is managed from DataContext.

    feat: New onion skin system.
    
    Now you can see the previous layer with a transparency.
    This is achieved with a new OnionSkin component, which renders the previous frame with transparency.

    fix: Minor fixes in the undo and redo system.
    
    Now moving a level layer counts as a valid action for the undoStack, and the undoObject.undoType system has also been slightly modified

    feat: New layer options
    
    Now you can rename a layer by double clicking on its name.
    Additionally, you can change the position of the layers using two icons that are shown in the layers section.
    
    Slight improvement in the keyframe creation function (handleNewEmptyFrame):
    Now the function needs a method as a parameter, which defines whether the new keyframes will be empty or a copy of the last keyframe of the layer.

    feat: Major changes in undo and redo system
    
    Undo System: Now each Object stores the global state of the application at the time the object is created and not the specific event.
    
    Layer Options: Layers can now be hidden and their opacity changed.

    chore: security backup before major changes
    
    This commit serves as a checkpoint before implementing
    significant changes to the system and application behavior.
    This backup ensures we have a stable version to revert to in
    case the new changes cause unexpected issues or failures.
    
    This will primarily save the integrity of the undo
    and redo system, as changes will be made to how they
    work and how data is stored in the following states:
    mainUndoStack, redoStack, layersUndoStack.

    feat: You can't draw in impossible situations
    feat: File section content
    
    New system:
    When you try to draw on a layer that does not
    have a keyframe for the current frame index,
    the cursor changes icon and it will be impossible
    to draw.
    
    I temporarily added a temporary container in file
    section to be able to display
    undoStack and redoStack

    feat: first version.
    
    Implementations so far:
    -drawing system. With two 4 functional tools:
    brush, eraser, undo, redo; Additionally,
    there are properties for some tools,
    colors for the brush, and stroke size for the
    brush and eraser.
    
    -layer system:
    multiple layers that are rendered in different
    zIndex and have different properties.
    
    -keyframe system:
    Each frame stores individual properties,
    and you can navigate between different frames on
    different layers.
